A factory produces three types of elements (A, B, C) which are painted in multiple colours. The order of painting matters becouse the paint is applied 
in layers to different fragments of the element and the duration of putting each paint also differs becouse it depends on the size and shape of surface which 
needs to be covered. At some point the elements are dried in a special oven and later, some finishing lacquers are applied:

A: red(15 min) -> green(10 min) -> oven: lower temperature(15 min) -> lacquer(10 min) -> enamel(5 min)
B: green(30 min) -> red(15 min) -> oven: high temperature(8 min) -> enamel(15 min) -> lacquer(10 min)
C: green(22 min) -> red(14 min) -> oven: lower temperature(15 min) -> lacquer(8 min) -> enamel(3 min)

Each paint or lacquer is applied by a different painting machine. Each of these machines can paint only one element at a time.
The oven has bigger capacity, however, and it can handle up to 2 items at a time. It is power consuming, so items dried in the same temperature should be dried
together (appropriate drying task should start at the same time). 
Assuming that we start painting all elements A-C at the same moment, is it possible to finish the whole process in 2:30 hours?
What is the detailed schedule?
