Student Bogdan is at the canteen. He is extremely hungry after a whole day of programming labs and
he has a limited budget for dinner – 25 zł – so he decided to spend it wisely and get the most
calories possible.
What should Bogdan order and how much would he pay for this? Assume that each dish may be
chosen only once (Adaś does not want to eat anything twice).
